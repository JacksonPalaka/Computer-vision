# Licence Plate Detection using a Custom Trained YOLO model

This repository contains a custom trained yolo11m model trained on a Licence dataset to detect Licence plates from any image or Video through frames.

License Plate Detection is a computer vision process used to detect vehicle number plates from images or video. The system captures frames from a camera and uses a detection model to identify the license plate region. Once detected, the plate area is cropped for further use. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) can be used to read the characters on the plate, but OCR has not been implemented yet in this system. The model is trained using a license plate dataset from Roboflow, which contains labeled images with bounding boxes under different lighting conditions, angles, and vehicle types.
